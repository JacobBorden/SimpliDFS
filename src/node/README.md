# Source Files for Node (`src/node/`)

This directory contains the C++ source code (.cpp files) for the SimpliDFS Storage Node. Each node is responsible for storing actual file data chunks, handling read/write requests for its data, and communicating with the Metaserver.

Corresponding header files can be found in `../../include/node/`.
