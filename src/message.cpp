// This file is intentionally left empty.
// The definitions for Message::Serialize and Message::Deserialize
// have been moved into src/message.h as inline static methods.
//
// This change was made to resolve persistent linker errors,
// likely related to C++ ABI compatibility issues or complexities
// in how the build system handled separate compilation of these
// static methods in this specific environment. By making them
// inline and defining them in the header, we ensure that each
// translation unit gets its own copy of the functions (if needed)
// or that they are truly inlined, circumventing the linker
// issues encountered with separate compilation.
//
// See src/message.h for the implementations.
