  prevents handle collisions when new files are created through FUSE.

## [0.3.55] - 2025-06-15
### Fixed
- FUSE adapter assigns unique file handles during `open`, preventing handle
  collisions that broke concurrent append and random write tests.
## [0.3.54] - 2025-06-13
### Fixed

  preventing false failures in `FuseRandomWriteTest` and `FuseAppendTest`.
## [0.3.53] - 2025-06-13
### Fixed
- Increased wait time for node registrations in the FUSE concurrency wrapper
  to prevent sporadic failures in `FuseRandomWriteTest` and `FuseAppendTest`.

  append operations in the FUSE adapter.
## [0.3.50] - 2025-06-11
### Fixed

  the FUSE adapter, preventing random write and append tests from failing when
  the metaserver is unavailable.
## [0.3.49] - 2025-06-11
### Fixed

## [0.3.47] - 2025-06-10

- Introduced `TruncateFile` message and metadata support.
- Added unit test verifying truncate updates file size.

## [0.3.38] - 2025-06-09

### Fixed
- Always call `posix_fallocate` after `ftruncate` and fall back to manual seek/write if needed. This guarantees correct preallocation on FUSE.

## [0.3.37] - 2025-06-09

### Fixed
- Stored file paths alongside open handles so `simpli_write` can recover the
  path when FUSE provides an empty string. This resolves preallocation failures
  in `FuseConcurrencyTest`.

## [0.3.36] - 2025-06-09

### Fixed
- Added additional fallback logic to `preallocateFile` for filesystems lacking
  `posix_fallocate` support, resolving test setup failures on FUSE.

## [0.3.32] - 2025-06-08

### Fixed
- CMake uses system-installed gRPC to avoid network downloads that caused
  configuration stalls. FuseConcurrencyTest now builds and runs reliably.

## [0.3.31] - 2025-06-08

### Fixed
- FuseConcurrencyTest now skips if the FUSE mount operation fails due to missing permissions.

## [0.3.30] - 2025-06-08

### Fixed
- Added portable fallback logic to `preallocateFile` so FUSE filesystems
  without full `ftruncate` support can still run `FuseConcurrencyTest`.

## [0.3.29] - 2025-06-08

### Fixed
- Reverted mount detection change in the FUSE test wrapper and restored the
  original sleep-based check.

## [0.3.28] - 2025-06-08
